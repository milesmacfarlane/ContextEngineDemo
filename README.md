# 🎨 Context Engine Demo

Interactive demonstration of the Statistics Question Generator with Rich Narrative Context Engine.

## 🌟 Features

- **50 Diverse Contexts** - From server tips to heart rate to file sizes
- **3 Narrative Levels** - Minimal, standard, or rich storytelling
- **8 Math Variations** - Calculate mean, find missing values, compare, and more
- **Smart Compatibility** - Only generates questions that make sense
- **Realistic Values** - Context-appropriate number ranges
- **Automatic Units** - Proper formatting ($, %, °C, bpm, MB, etc.)

## 📦 What's Inside

- **50 Contexts** across 13 categories:
  - Physical (lengths, areas, volumes, masses)
  - Recreation (running, cycling, music)
  - Health (heart rate, calories, blood pressure)
  - Transportation (speeds, distances, times)
  - Household (cooking, utilities, bills)
  - Academic (test scores, grades)
  - Environmental (temperature, rainfall)
  - Digital (file sizes, download speeds)
  - And more!

## 🎓 Educational Impact

Students see math in contexts they care about:
- 📱 Digital contexts (file sizes, bandwidth)
- 🏃 Fitness contexts (heart rate, calories)
- 🎵 Music contexts (tempo, duration)
- 🚗 Transportation (commute time, speed)
- 🏠 Household (bills, cooking)

Math becomes **relevant and engaging**!

## 🏗️ How It Works

1. Select a **math variation** (calculate mean, find missing value, etc.)
2. Choose a **context** (or let it pick randomly)
3. Set **narrative level** (minimal, standard, or rich)
4. Adjust **difficulty** (1-5)
5. Generate and see the magic!
